
                           STYLES IN AKKAR

The styles in AKKAR are all put into separate stylesheets in directories 
named after the name of the style. Within that directory are all the files
tied to the style, as well as several images. By all rights, the styles
should probably be called themes instead.

The files are:

STYLESHEETS

common.css
The common stylesheet used by all browsers

iestyle.css
The stylesheet used by Internet Explorer in addition to common.css

operastyle.css
The stylesheet used by Opera in addition to common.css

style.css
The stylesheet used by all other browsers in addition to common.css. It is 
also used by default in case any of iestyle.css or operastyle.css are missing.

print.css
The stylesheet used for printer-friendly versions of the pages

IMAGES

logo.png
The toplogo used in AKKAR.

logo_bw.png
The toplogo used in print-friendly pages.

dot.png, nodot.png, dot_print.png, nodot_print.png
The graphic used to display dots in sheets using a template with the "dots" 
fieldtype.

tinyarrow_up.png and tinyarrow_down.png
The graphic used for sorting-links in various lists (previously AKKAR used the
HTML entities &dArr; and &uArr; for this, but IE doesn't support them).

info.png, help.png, deadline.png, task.png
Graphics used as clickable icons in several places.

no_mugshot_f.png, no_mugshot_m.png, no_mugshot_f_print.jpg, no_mugshot_m_print.jpg
Images used as default person mugshots. The print ones are used for document exports 
only and has to be a jpg image. The regular mugshots can be png, jpg or gif.
mugshot_f is used for female, mugshot_m is used for male.

icon_cdup.png, icon_audio.png, icon_binary.png, icon_dir.png, icon_image.png
icon_text.png, icon_video.png, icon_zip.png
These are used as icons in the filesystem. icon_cdup is used only for linking
to the parent directory, the rest are used for the files of the appropriate type.
These should be kept small or the filesystem display will become very cluttered
very fast.

symb_male.png, symb_female.png
Symbols for male and female. There's also an symb_unknown_gender.png, but since
gender is a required field and gets validated clientside it's mostly useless. It's
only there for those who upgraded from RAsLAV 2.0 as pre-2.2 did not have a gender-
field.

BUTTONS (new in v2.4.0)

Navigation buttons within AKKAR can now be replaced with graphics rather than the
HTML buttons previously used. In order to do this, the buttons must be located in
a subdir of the style directory named after the shorthand of the configured language
(ex. styles/default/en/ or styles/default/nor).
If a specific button is missing an HTML button will be drawn instead.

For all images in a style, you can use either a PNG, JPG or GIF image. The 
only exceptions are pictures named like "_print", which can not be in GIF
format. It's generally a good idea to avoid GIF's entirely anyway, as there are
licensing-issues with the format. PNG and JPG are strongly favoured. AKKAR will 
first look for PNG images, next JPG, and lastly GIF's, so if you have both a PNG 
and a JPG of a given image in the directory, the PNG will be used.

You'll probably be able to use the graphics from one of the styles that
are included with AKKAR (except maybe the logos), just make sure you use 
one with a colour that's visible in your lists and sheets.

If you want to make your own style, simply copy the directory containing the
style you want to use as a basis and give it the name of your new style. Then
make the changes and adjustments you want to use. It's important that you don't
edit any of the existing styles as they will be overwritten next time you upgrade 
AKKAR to a new release.

If you leave out any of the images, the relevant image from the default style 
will be used.

The stylesheets in the default style are the only ones completely commented, 
so it's reccomended that you use those as a basis for your own style.

CUSTOM HEADERS (new in v2.4.0)

This option is for advanced users only.

If your style includes border graphics, or you wish to insert some custom
headers for any other reason, you can override the default headers. If the
files mainheader.php and/or mainfooter.php exist in your style directory
(i.e. styles/mystyle/mainheader.php and styles/mystyle/mainfooter.php),
they will completely override the default templates/mainheader.php and
templates/mainfooter.php.

It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you make copies of templates/mainheader.php and
templates/mainfooter.php and modify them, or you might be in trouble.
